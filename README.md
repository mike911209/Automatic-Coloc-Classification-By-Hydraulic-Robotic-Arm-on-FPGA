# Automatic Coloc Classification By Hydraulic Robotic Arm on FPGA

### Language
* Verilog
* Python

### Folders
* `./Final_Project`: the Vivado project
* `./proposal`: proposal of out implementation
* `./report`: report of out final implementation, there are some difference from out original proposal
* `./utils`: utility for KNN color classification, the code is from [github repo](https://github.com/ahmetozlu/color_recognition)
* `project folder`: verilog and python source code

### Proposal
This is the final project of the course **NTHU, Hardware design lab**, so we propose a proposal to describe the plan and the key concept of our project, you can refer to the proposal under `./proposal` folder

### Report
Due to some constraint, our final result are not quite exactly the same as our origin proposal. You can refer to `./report` to see detail explanation of our implementation and the outcome.

### Demo
For the demo video, you can refer to `./demo` folder or this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ia0PHZth9sduqlt7a2sNz5kfgA6AjJln/view?usp=sharing)

### How to run our project
* Prepare the same hardware
* Write binary of our implementation into FPGA board
* Attach web cam and connect your PC to FPGA board
* Run Uart.py
* Start!
